# Learning with Scarce Labeled Data

Deep learning methods generally require large amounts of annotated data to prevent overfitting problem, which is a common concern when the model fitted to a limited training set results in a poor generalization ability to test data. However, high-quality annotated datasets are scarce in the medical domain, especially in *medical image segmentation* and *rare disease diagnosis*. Because manual pixel-wise annotations in medical image segmentation requires professional medical knowledge as well as a high degree of concentration, and it is hard to collect sufficient training data for rare diseases in practice. Consequently, the lack of abundant annotated datasets becomes a bottleneck to deep learning-based methods in medical image analysis. We are interested in learning with scarce labeled data through data augmentation and few-shot learning.
