* I received B. Eng. degree in Department of Biomedical Engineering at **Beihang University (BUAA)** in 2018. 
* I was a research assistant in Department of Electrical Engineering at **Tsinghua University** during 2017-2018.<!-- , advised by Prof. Yongfeng Huang.  -->
* My research interests include medical image analysis and deep learning. Recently, I am dedicated to out-of-distribution generalization, zero/few-shot learning, learning with noisy labels. Previously, I studied topics of making adequate use of unlabeled data and augmenting the limited labeled data for data-efficient deep learning.
