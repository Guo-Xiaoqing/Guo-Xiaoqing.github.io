* I am currently a fourth year (2021-2022) Ph.D. student in Department of Electrical Engineering at **City University of Hong Kong (CityU)**, supervised by Prof. <a href="http://www.ee.cityu.edu.hk/~yxyuan/index.htm" target="_blank">Yixuan Yuan</a>.
* I received B. Eng. degree in Department of Biomedical Engineering at **Beihang University (BUAA)** in 2018. 
* I was a research assistant in Department of Electrical Engineering at **Tsinghua University** during 2017-2018, supervised by Prof. Yongfeng Huang. 
* My research interests include medical image analysis and deep learning. Recently, I am dedicated to out-of-distribution generalization, learning with noisy labels, few-shot learning. Previously, I studied topics of making adequate use of unlabeled data and augmenting the limited labeled data for data-efficient deep learning.
