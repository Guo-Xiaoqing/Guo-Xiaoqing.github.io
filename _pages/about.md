## Biography
Xiaoqing Guo is an assistant professor in the <a href="https://www.comp.hkbu.edu.hk/v1/" target="_blank">Department of Computer Science<a/> at Hong Kong Baptist University. She is also a visiting researcher affiliated with the <a href="https://eng.ox.ac.uk/biomedical-image-analysis/noble-group/" target="_blank">Noble Group</a> at the University of Oxford. She was a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Engineering Science at the University of Oxford, working on the projects <a href="https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/projects/visualai/" target="_blank">VisualAI</a> and Turing AI WLR Fellowship, during 2023-2024. She obtained her Ph.D. degree in the Department of Electrical Engineering at City University of Hong Kong in 2022 and received her B.Eng. degree from Beihang University in 2018. She was a research assistant in the Department of Electrical Engineering at Tsinghua University during 2017-2018. Her research interest is in the interdisciplinary field of AI and healthcare, aiming to create innovative intelligent systems that can support high-quality human-machine interaction/collaboration and trustworthy clinical decision-making. In AI and medical imaging fields, she has published over 30 top journal and conference papers, including Nature Biomedical Engineering, TPAMI, IJCV, CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, TMI, MedIA, MICCAI, IPMI, and Nature. She has been selected as one of *World’s Top 80 Chinese Young Female Scholars in AI*, the *Rising Star of Women in Engineering* by Asian Deans' Forum 2024, and she has received prestigious awards, such as CVPR Outstanding Reviewer Award, MSRA Fellowship Nomination Award, Outstanding Doctoral Research Award, Outstanding Research Thesis Award, and three year consecutive Outstanding Academic Performance Award.

## Research Interests
* My research interest is in the interdisciplinary field of medical data analysis, computer vision, and machine learning, aiming to create innovative intelligent systems that can support high-quality **human-machine interaction/collaboration** and **trustworthy clinical decision-making**. 
* Recently, I am dedicated to (1) multimodal learning with 2D/3D image, video, audio, clinical text report, probe motion modalities, (2) human-machine interaction/collaboration for shared human-machine decision-making in healthcare. 
* Previously, I focused on developing <a href="https://guo-xiaoqing.github.io/research/" target="_blank">annotation-efficient deep learning</a> solutions, such as data augmentation, semi-supervised learning, domain adaptation, out-of-distribution generalization, and learning with noisy labels, to achieve trustworthy and effective intelligent systems.
